# ember-project

This simple Ember app is returning 100 posts from the JSONPlaceholder API. When you click on the button, it will bring up the body of that post in a modal.

I have not used Ember before, I have used React before, but I did like what I have learned so far about Ember, it seems like a very good framework. I did not get to get the pagination to work, I feel with more time to learn and practice in Ember I would be able to figure it out. I did not use Bootstrap or any other front end framework, I did use Sass to help with the CSS and really enjoyed learning/using it also. And the site/app is responsive.
